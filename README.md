# myPythonExploration
My exploration in Python programming world.  I post here regularly my exercises in python whether it's a game, a simple program, and web applications from flasks and django.

Please feel free to fork, view, or leave some comments in order for me to improve more in Python programming.

copyContents.py - Access this program then run in the terminal.  Just create even a single test file that contains any contents.  The program will create a new file if the second argument file didn't exist. (e.g. copyContents.py test1.txt test2.txt)

deleteCreateContents.py - This will delete the contents of the file then the program will allow you to create new contents of the file.  Run deleteCreateContents.py test.txt (or any dummy file that you are willing to mess around)

basicMoodAnalysis.py - Basic mood anlysis.  User will input sentence then determine if his/her mood is sad, normal, happy, or very happy.

searchAWord.py - open a text file from a terminal (e.g. python test.txt) then ask for any words, search thru the file, then print the matched words.
